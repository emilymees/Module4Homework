PyCity Schools Analysis  -  Emily Boulware


- The "Scores by School Spending" and "Score by School Size" DataFrame summaries both show that the smaller budget ranges and least amount of students have better overall passing performance. We can also summarize from the results that Charter schools have the least number of total students and by majority, smaller budgets.

 - Surprisingly, even though District schools have the higher spending ranges per student, Charter schools have the higher "% Overall Passing" students. 
 
- This was not a direct result provided in the assignment requirements, but something I concluded based on the results that were provided - Looking at the overall Per Student Budget using Total School Budget and Total Students I'm finding that on average, District schools spend $643.09/student while Charter schools spend $598.78/student. If Charter schools are able to spend $44.31 less per student and still achieve a +90% passing rate, then it would be very beneficial to gather more data (like number of students per teacher, teacher education level or number of years employed, family income ranges, ethnicity, etc.) to try to pinpoint areas where Charter schools seem to have the advantage. This would not only pontentially help increase District schools passing rates, but could also help lower District school spending.
